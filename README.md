# KPI-Reporting-R-automation
This project contains R scripts that automate the transposition of SQL files to an Excel file with 3 sheets named KPI_Report_ES_03. Additionally, the project generates an additional file named ES_KPI_Daily_Summary, which summarizes the information from KPI_Report_ES_03 on a daily basis. The Daily KPI Summary file provides an overview of the performance metrics for the day and serves as a quick reference for stakeholders.
