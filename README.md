# KPI-Reporting-R-automation
This project contains R scripts that automate the transposition of SQL files to an Excel file with 3 sheets named KPI_Report_ES_03. Additionally, the project generates an additional file named ES_KPI_Daily_Summary, which summarizes the information from KPI_Report_ES_03 on a daily basis. The Daily KPI Summary file provides an overview of the performance metrics for the day and serves as a quick reference for stakeholders.

## Usage 
The data used in this project is entirely fictional and intended solely for demonstration purposes. However, it's important to note that SQL files don't provide access to external customers. These SQL files are designed for presentation purposes.

## Description
The R scripts in this project execute SQL queries to retrieve data from a database and transpose the result data frames to Excel worksheets. One of the SQL queries used in the project, Withdrawal_Amounts_ES_PIVOT.sql, includes a pivot operation at the SQL level. This query aggregates transaction data for a certain period of time and creates a new table with summarized information pivoted on specific columns. The pivot operation transforms the data from a long format to a wide format, making it easier to summarize and analyze the data. The resulting pivoted data is then transposed to an Excel worksheet and saved in the KPI_Report_ES_03.xlsx file. In the resulting Excel file, the Withdrawal_Amounts_ES worksheet contains the transaction data summarized by transaction channel (Online, POS, and ATM) and type (count and amount) for a certain period of time. 

The Daily KPI Summary file provides an overview of the performance metrics for the day and serves as a quick reference for stakeholders. This Excel file contains several worksheets, including a summary of the total number of approved clients and activated clients for the day, as well as a breakdown of the withdrawal amounts by transaction channel (Online, POS, and ATM) and type (count and amount). The Daily KPI Summary file is designed to be easy to read and understand, making it an effective tool for decision-making and communication among stakeholders.
